Make canvas resize if window resized
  Problem: must force redraw, since canvas goes blank when resized
    Which means that Canvas would need reference to TowerManager
  Canvas.prototype.make_canvas_resize_if_window_resized = function() {
    var self = this;
    window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
        self.resize_to_client_width();
    }, false);
  }
